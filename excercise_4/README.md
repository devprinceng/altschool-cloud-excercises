## Task:
- Install PHP 7.4 on your local linux machine using the ppa:ondrej/php package repo.

### Instruction:**<br/>
- Learn how to use the add-apt-repository command
- Submit the content of /etc/apt/sources.list and the output of php -v command.

**What is `add-apt-repository` command?**<br/>
The `add-apt-repository` command in Ubuntu is used to add a new repository to your system's list of package sources.
The syntax is: `sudo add-apt-repository repository_url` where *repository_url* is the url of your repository which could be a ppa,i.e personal package archive.<br/><br/>

To install PHP I ran the command below <br>  `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php`

After that I ran `sudo apt update` then also ran `php -v` it didn't still work for me.

So i did `sudo apt install php` and that did the magic though i now had PHP8 which is okay ðŸ˜Ž, installed php successfully

And finally `php -v` to show the php version installed.
